          <h5> Mary's Peak, Corvallis OR</h5>
          <p> Here are pictures from when I've gone hiking @ Mary's Peak in Corvallis. I took the above photos on different days. I really like these photos as they're really pretty. 
            And I especially really love the middle one as you can really see how tall the trees are in comparison to my friend in the middle. 
            To me, I think he's pretty tall (I'm 5'6 and he's 6'2) so it makes me happy knowing he's small in the grand scheme of things.
            The photos also show the beautiful weather I was having on all of the days I went there. You can see the flowers blooming and the bright skies in my pictures.
            Photos are really nice for capturing the beauty of things and for documentation but it's also really nice for memory keeping purposes.
          </p>

          <p> These photos fulfill the Connections-Photo section of my field guide as here are some pictures I documented and took when I went out into the field. 
            For example, I could use the third image to try and classify the purple flower in the image (So far, I think it's close to a whiteleaf lupine but I am not quite sure) or I could use these images to explain about the weather and geography at Mary's Peak.
            Or I could use the last image to discuss human impact on Mary's Peak as there is a man-made path.
            Images are great for documentation and for making visual knowledge of concepts and places more readily and easily accessible. </p>

          <h5> Rose Gall </h5>
          <p> Here, I sketched the rose galls we saw in our lecture videos.  <br> <br> In response to parasitic wasps larva that are placed on the rose bushes the rose bushes grows scar tissue around the parasite to protect itself. The larva benefits from this relationship as they now have a home! </p>
