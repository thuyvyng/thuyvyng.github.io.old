    <h3> Welcome to my website! </h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>  My name is ThuyVy. I am a rising senior at Oregon State studying Computer Science. 
          I like topics including: software engineering, ai, visualization, and hci. My favorite language is python.</p>
        <p> When I am not doing cs-related things I like to: travel, hike, eat, shop, take pictures, and hang out with friends/family. 
          My favorite place I have ever been is Thailand. 
          The food is amazing (my favorite) and it is so unbelievably beautiful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br385_yB0kB/">(Phi Phi Islands - wow!) </a>. 
          I usually take pictures with my phone but I also use my Canon T6i and I usually like to take pictures of people and nature. 
          I took a night photograpy class at Oregon State which I took to good use 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2dKNZBh4Iv/"> when I saw the Northern Lights in Alaska. </a> </p>

        <p> I live in, was born in, and raised in Oregon. As such, I think I'm pretty qualified to recommend places to go. Here is my official list of best places in Oregon.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Trillium Lake </li>
          <li> Three Pools </li>
          <li> Punch Bowl Falls </li>
          <li> Cathedral Park</li>
          <li> Blue Pool </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Other things I think are important to know about me. My go-to starbucks order is an iced white mocha (no whipped cream) or strawberry acai refresher if it's too late for coffee. 
          The most embarrassing thing about me is that I learned how to ride a bike on my 18th birthday and honestly I am still really bad.
          And lastly, I fully support pineapple on pizza. </p>
