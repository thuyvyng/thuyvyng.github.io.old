      <h4> bi101 - fall 2020</h4>

      <hr>

      <p> Here I created a web page for my Bi101 class. I seperated the page into sections according to the assignment outline; you can see the table of contents below. </p>

      <p>This field guide shows my mastery over the course material as you can see all the concepts I learned through my quiz answers and
        how I have taken the knowledge from the course and created meaningful media places. 
        I have included lots of definitons of key concepts in this class such as biodiversity, conservation biology, keystone species, and more. 
        Lastly, you can see how I have used knowledge I have learned from this class and applied to my everyday life.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        This field guide will likely be very useful in the future, especially the skills section. Here, I will have an already prepared checklist for when I go on explorations.  
        I included a field work safety checklist, lab safety checklist, and a what to bring guide on as well. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-10"> 
        <h4> <a name="biodiversity"></a>Biodiversity </h4>
        <p style="  font-style: italic;"> Study of the variety life on Earth at three levels.  Most common is the diversity of species: the number of different species, including their identification and classification.</p>
        <p> Here, I show my knowledge about biodiversity by describing the diversity of species by comparing squirrels with other mammals,describing the diversity of ecocsystems on earth by discussing tropical rainforests, and discussing the nitrogen cycle.</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Squirrels are mammals; what are two characteristics that they share with other mammals in general and two characteristics that they share with other rodents specifically. </b> <br>
            Squirrels and other mammals maintain a relatively constant internal body temperature, they have mammary glands that produce milk, they have neocortex brain structure, and they have 3 middle ear bones.
            Squirrels and other rodents have continually growing incisor teeth that they use to gnaw at food, dig tunnels, and that they use to defend themselves. Most rodents are small with short limbs and a long tail. Squirrels and most rodents eat seeds and they stash their seeds in reserve.
            </li>
          <li> <b>Explain how tropical rainforest ecosystems have high productivity and high biodiversity while the soils are relatively nutrient poor.</b>  Tropical rainforests are consistently hot and wet throughout the year. This is the perfect condition for photosynthesis year around which gives it high productivity. The soil can be nutrient poor because the organisms in these tropical rainforests ecosystems have the nutrients and this ecosystem has a tight nutrient cycling, and so therefore the ecosystem doesn’t lack nutrients. It gets the nutrients from the organisms not from the soil.</li>
          <li><b> Explain the significance of bacteria in the nitrogen cycle, including why you need them in a fish (or shrimp) tank. </b> These bacteria convert the ammonium into more useable and safer forms of nitrogen such as nitrite or nitrate. Without these bacteria, the fish tank will be an unsafe environment for these organisms to live in and they will ultimately die due to unhealthy nitrogen forms. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> <a name="ecology"></a>Ecology </h4>
        <p style="  font-style: italic;"> Interactions that occur between living organisms and the environment.  This can include interactions within a species, between different species within a community, and between species and their physical environment.  These interactions can be complex and interdependent, they can even change over time and distance.</p>

        <p> I demonstrate my understanding of ecology by explaining what keystone species are and their impact with examples of real animals as well as describing influences in our local pacfiic northwest by invasive species.</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Define Keystone Species</b> <br> Keystone species are species that have a disproportionately dramatic impact on the ecosystem they are a part of. For example, beavers are a keystone species because they are able to maintain and alter logs (such as altering dams and waterways) to impact the ecosystem. In the previous lecture, we also saw that Sea Otters are also considered a keystone species. When sea otters were removed, we saw that this greatly reduced the amount of kelp available as sea otters were no longer there to keep the number of sea urchins (who eat the kelp) at a good level.</li>
          <li> <b> Explain why beavers are significant forces within ecosystems. (Go Beavs!) </b> <br>
            Beavers are considered a keystone species meaning that they have a high impact on their ecosystem. This is because they have the ability to drastically alter the environment by their ability to remove trees and to build dams. This affects the nutrient retention (as dams build up nutrients) and it enables the environment to be a diverse habitat (as the removal of trees and building dams can drastically alter the area).
            </li>
           <li> <b>Describe how gorse has impacted pacific northwest coastal beaches and what is being done to manage these invasive plants. </b> <br>
            Gorse is a highly invasive weed that threatens pacific northwest coast beaches by impacting farming, grazing, forestry, recreation, and native plants and animals. Some ways to manage these plants are to make sure the gorse doesn’t spread by cleaning all tools and equipment. Other methods include using herbicide to control and get rid of these weeds.
            </li> 
        </ul>
        <h4> <a name="cb"></a>Conservation Biology </h4>
        <p style="  font-style: italic;"> Researches how to conserve organisms and their ecosystems. </p>
        <p> Here, I explain how everyone can do their part in conserving organisms and their ecossystem; which includes how we can collect items more sustainability or how to get involved in the community.</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>  <b> Describe how to collect items while also reducing potential negative impact on organisms and the environment: </b> <br>
            One thing to do is collect from other people’s collection. In the video, Leslie explains how collecting rocks can be expensive and bad for the environment. Instead, we should collect things from others so we don’t harm the environment.Another thing to do is to collect found items such as garbage and to retask them. Here, removing these items will not negatively impact the organisms and the environment, it may actually improve the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Provide specific examples of strategies used to attempt to save species from extinction, including the organism and the technique(s) used. </b> <br>
Some examples of strategies used to save species from extinction include: maintaining their habitats, monitoring and breeding programs. Maintaining habitats is a strategy employed to save the Pacific Salmon, people are working together to preserve and maintain their habitats and prevent any additional loss of their habitats. For the Florida Panther, these animals are being monitored by scientists using trackers. These scientists then try to prevent these animals from harm and try to heal animals that have been harmed. For example, if they see that a Panther has been still for too long this may suggest that this animal has been injured and the team will go to rescue and save the animal and provide it with care.

        <h4> <a name="explanation"></a>Explanation</h4>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Providing information on how or why something happens.  </p>
        <p>Explanation is an important part of science discovery as now we get to understand why things occur they way they do, and here I explain how do succulents survive in harsh conditions and I explain why some things are considered live and somethings aren't.</p>
  
        <hr>
  
        <p> <b>Explain what a succulent plant is, including (1) three ways succulents can be structured to survive in desert environments and (2) specific examples of succulent plants, including where they store their water. </b> <br>
          Succulents can plants that store water in their roots, stems, and leaves; this tactic allows them to survive in desert environments. Succulents can also structure themselves to survive in desert environments by stacking their leaves to reduce exposure to the high heat and by having funnel shapes to collect as much water as possible. Some examples of succulents include: Cacti and Aloe Vera which store their water in the stems.

        <h5> <b> 8 Characteristics of Life </b></h5>
        <p> These characteristics explain the necessary components to definitively say that something is live. For example, in order to be able you need to be able to reproduce. 
          So in order to prove that something is alive, you need to be able to explan how they pass these 8 characteristics.

          <h4> <a name="photos"></a>Photos </h4>
          <p> Here I fulfill one of the Connection settings and include lots of photos I have taken. Photos can help you clearly document and share what you find on explorations. They can be useful in identifying constellations or flowers and many more.</p>

          <h5> Mary's Peak, Corvallis OR</h5>
          <p> Here are some pictures I documented and took when I went out hiking @ Mary's Peak in Corvallis. I took the above photos on different days. I really like these photos as they're really pretty. 
            And I especially really love the middle one as you can really see how tall the trees are in comparison to my friend in the middle. 
            To me, I think he's pretty tall (I'm 5'6 and he's 6'2) so it makes me happy knowing he's small in the grand scheme of things.
            The photos also show the beautiful weather I was having on all of the days I went there. You can see the flowers blooming and the bright skies in my pictures.
            Photos are really nice for capturing the beauty of things and for documentation but it's also really nice for memory keeping purposes.
          </p>

          <p> 
            Here, I could use the third image to try and classify the purple flower in the image (So far, I think it's close to a whiteleaf lupine but I am not quite sure) or I could use these images to explain about the weather and geography at Mary's Peak.
            Or I could use the last image to discuss human impact on Mary's Peak as there is a man-made path.
            Images are great for documentation and for making visual knowledge of concepts and places more readily and easily accessible. </p>

            <h5>Northern Lights in Alaska - Pictures</h5>
            <p> I took HC407: Imaging the Universe at Oregon State University and I learned all about how to take pictures of cool astronomical events. 
              While, we never learned about how to image the Northern Lights I tried to use what I learned about imaging stars here. In this image you can see one of the dipper constellations among the the Northern Lights. This photo helped me identify that this is the Big Dipper.</p>

          <h4> <a name="fields"></a>Field Sketches</h4>
          <p> These sketches are a cool way to document things you see in the field. Here you can really note on things you notice and put your own artistic spin, here I drew some sketches or the Northern Lights and of the Rose Gall we watched in lectures.</p>
          <img src="juliandrawing.jpeg" width ="70%" />
          <h5> Northern Lights in Alaska - Drawing</h5>
          <p> Here, I have a drawing and an actual image I took when I saw the Northern Lights. I am not the best at night photography so I kind of comically tried to draw what it looked like. So while my camera was taking pictures of the Northern Lights, I was also trying to draw it at the same time to really remember the experience. I did get a couple of (what I think to be cool) shots in.</p>

          <img src="rosegall.png" width ="70%" />
          <h5> Rose Gall </h5>
          <p> Here, I sketched the rose galls we saw in our lecture videos.  <br> <br> In response to parasitic wasps larva that are placed on the rose bushes the rose bushes grows scar tissue around the parasite to protect itself. The larva benefits from this relationship as they now have a home! </p>

          <h4> <a name="writing"></a>Writing</h4>
          <p> Writing is a very powerful tool and I think it is the best for putting your thoughts in and your own perspective. So for my last connections, I decided to choose writing so that I could discuss some of my own more personal wants that I have developed because of this course through my Bioogy Bucket List!</p>
          <h5> Biology Bucket List</h5>
          <p> Here are a list of things I want to accomplish before I kick the bucket! </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Tour the MOMA, the MET, the Louvre, and the Museum of Pop Culture. 
              <ul>
                <li> While I have been to New York, Paris, and Seattle. I never really went to the museums since my family aren't huge museum people (we weren't there for very long). 
                  But I would really love to go to these museums and explore for a whole day. I'm moving to Seattle next year, so hopefully I'll finally be able to see the Museum of Pop Culture.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Watch the Northern Lights in Iceland. 
              <ul>
                <li> I've seen the Northern Lights in Alaska but the visibility was low-ish when I went. So I'd love to go again and see it in Iceland since I've never traveled around Iceland. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Visit the Grand Canyon, Big Sur, and Yellowstone.</li>
            <li> Build a sand collection from various beaches I travel.
                <ul>
                  <li> I actually started this collection when I was in the 6th grade when I went to Jamaica. I had sand from Jamaica, Mexico, and Aruba. However, I forgot to continue this collection and would really like to continue it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Build a collection of rocks from everyplace I hike. </li>
            <li> Selfie collection in every state/country I travel to. 
              <ul>
                <li> I'm honestly really bad at getting pictures of myself and I am not a selfie person so I figured this would be a good way to fix both problems in one go. 
                  Hopefully, I'll master the art of selfies. I do feel like I always forget where I travelled to and taking selfies would be a great way to remember where I've been and to prove to people I've been places. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
